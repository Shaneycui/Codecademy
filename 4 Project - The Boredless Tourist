Setting Up Your Project
1.
We here at The Boredless Tourist believe that mistakes should be easily corrected, so we keep all of our code version controlled using git.

Start by running git init in the terminal.

2.
We’ll be doing most of our coding in script.py so we want to make sure that we are tracking that in git.

Add script.py to git’s staging area.

3.
Let’s create the first commit for this project.

Perform a git commit with the message "initial commit"

4.
Now let’s create some data that we’re going to use to test the functionality that we create for The Boredless Tourist.

The first is our list of destinations that we’re going to be using.

Create a list with the following destinations and save it into a variable called destinations.

“Paris, France”
“Shanghai, China”
“Los Angeles, USA”
“São Paulo, Brazil”
“Cairo, Egypt”
5.
And let’s define a test traveler to see how our functionality is working so far.

Create a test_traveler variable. Assign to it the following list:

['Erin Wilkes', 'Shanghai, China', ['historical site', 'art']]
This is a traveler (a user of The Boredless Tourist application) whose name is Erin Wilkes who likes historical buildings and art. Erin is in China right now, hopefully we can find some good places to show her.

6.
Looks like we’ve got some good sample data to get started with. Let’s commit these changes.

First, save the file, then add script.py to the git index using git add.

7.
Next, perform a git commit with the message "Added test objects".
